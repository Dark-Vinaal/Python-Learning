# 🗓️ Day 4 — Python Interpreter, Compiler & How It Works

Hi everyone 👋  
Today (Day 4),Also my mentor explained how **Python runs code** using an **interpreter and compiler**, and compared it with **Java** and **C++**.  

---

## 🐍 Python: Interpreter and Compiler

- **Python is written in C**, which is why it runs fast and efficiently.  
- Python uses **both a compiler and an interpreter** internally:
  1. **Compiler:** Converts Python code into **bytecode** (`.pyc` files).  
  2. **Interpreter:** Reads the bytecode and executes it **line by line**.  

**Key points:**
- Python is **interpreted**, meaning it executes code on the fly.  
- Errors are shown immediately, making debugging easier.  
- Ideal for **learning, scripting, and rapid development**.

## 💻 Java: Compiler + JVM

- Java code is first **compiled** using `javac` into **bytecode** (`.class` files).  
- Bytecode runs on the **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**, which acts like an **interpreter**.  
- This allows Java to be **platform-independent** — “write once, run anywhere.”

---

## 💡 C++: Fully Compiled

- C++ code is **compiled directly** into **machine code** using a compiler (e.g., `g++`).  
- Machine code runs **directly on the computer hardware**.  
- Faster execution compared to interpreted languages but requires **manual compilation** every time you change the code.

## ⚖️ Quick Comparison

| Language | How it Runs | Speed | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|-------|
| Python | Compiled to bytecode → Interpreted line by line | Moderate | Easy to debug, slower than C++ |
| Java | Compiled to bytecode → Run on JVM | Moderate | Platform-independent |
| C++ | Fully compiled to machine code | Fast | Must recompile after changes |

## 🧠 Summary

- Python uses **interpreter + compiler** → easy to learn, quick feedback.  
- Java uses **compiler + JVM** → cross-platform.  
- C++ uses **direct compilation** → very fast, low-level control.  

> Understanding how **code is executed** helps in choosing the right language for your project and optimizing performance.
