## 📘 Overview
This repository contains all my **daily coding tasks** completed during a **30-day Python internship**.  
Each day’s progress is organized folder-wise (`Day 1 → Day 30`) with code files and notes.

This public repository serves both as my personal learning tracker and as a **free resource** for anyone who wants to **learn Python** through real-world exercises and structured examples.

> Note : I'm familiar with the term coding because of my previous knowledge in Java and C++, so I have written this repo project in my way of understanding.
